// response events

// This module optionally exports the following methods:
// start(params, request, response, context) - Called at the beginning of every response
// end(params, request, response, context) - Called at the end of every response (after the response has been sent to the client)

// If you have no use for this file, you can delete it.


export const start = (params, request, response, context) => {
  // Anything you want to happen at the beginning of a response
}


export const end = (params, request, response, context) => {
  // Anything you want to happen at the end of a response
}
