[0.3.9]
  * Added an error handler for EADDRNOTAVAIL (hostname unavailable/already in use)
  * Moved hasOwnProperty check in app.extend() to outer if statement so it covers both conditions

[0.3.8]
  * app.copy() and app.extend() bug fixes and performance improvements
  * Made startup messaging consistent with actual settings

[0.3.7]
  * Fixed a bug in log()
  * app.config.hostname can be set to an empty string, allowing responses from any host
  * Switched object "deletions" to use null instead of undefined
  * Added config descriptions to readme
  * Removed index entry point (redundant)

[0.3.6]
  * Added another error scenario for HTTP port availability

[0.3.5]
  * Added httpPort to the skeleton app config because it's easier on new users to modify that setting if it's already there

[0.3.4]
  * Fixed a major bug in app.log() that pretty much broke logging entirely
  * Added a timestamp option to app.log() that lets you disable the timestamp in the log output
  * Added error handling for some common server startup problems and friendly messaging to aid in troubleshooting
  * Improved formatting for startup logs

[0.3.3]
  * Readme fixes

[0.3.2]
  * Added a util directory with a scaffolding CLI. You can now create an app skeleton and generate MVC patterns automagically. See the readme for instructions.

[0.3.1]
  * Readme fixes

[0.3.0]
  * BREAKING CHANGE: citizen includes are now self-contained and only play in their own sandbox. They no longer receive updated context from the calling controller, and they no longer pass their own content and directives into the request context. This just makes more sense and avoids a lot of pitfalls I was experiencing in my own projects.
  * BREAKING CHANGE: Completely rewrote caching, fixing bugs and making additions such as a custom scope option, allowing for easy deletion of groups of cached items. Please see the readme for changes to app.cache(), app.exists(), app.retrieve(), and app.clear(), which now all take options objects instead of a list of arguments.
  * BREAKING CHANGE: app.size() now throws an error if the provided argument isn't an object literal
  * Fixed several bugs in server.js that broke controller caching, route cache expiration, and cache URL params validation
  * Added app.log() helper to make it easier to log application events to the console or files based on application mode (production, debug, etc.)
  * Added prettyHTML config setting for Jade templates in production mode (default is true, setting it to false removes all whitespace between tags)
  * Fixed the default action in params.route.chain ('handler')
  * Rewrote app.dashes(), fixing a few bugs and adding a fallback option that gets returned if the parsed string ends up being empty

[0.2.14]
  * The ctznRedirect session variable now has a cookie fallback if sessions aren't enabled
  * Fixed a bug in direct cookie assignments

[0.2.13]
  This is the beginning of the change log. I think citizen is "complete" enough to warrant it.

  * BREAKING CHANGE: Changed params.route.pathName to params.route.pathname
  * Enhanced redirect functionality
